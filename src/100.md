1. The initial part of a request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The server intends to send a final response after the request has been fully received and acted upon.
1. When the request contains an `Expect` header field that includes a `100-continue` expectation, the `100` response indicates that the server wishes to receive the request payload body.<!--[^expect-request-field]--> The client ought to continue sending the request and discard the `100` response.
1. If the request did not contain an `Expect` header field containing the `100-continue` expectation, the client can simply discard this interim response.
