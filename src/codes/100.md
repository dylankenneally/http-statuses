body: |
  The HTTP `100 Continue` informational status response code indicates that everything so far is OK and that the client should continue with the request or ignore it if it is already finished.

  To have a server check the request's headers, a client **must** send `Expect: 100-continue` as a header in its initial request and receive a `100 Continue` status code in response before sending the body.

1. The initial part of a request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The server intends to send a final response after the request has been fully received and acted upon.
1. When the request contains an `Expect` header field that includes a `100-continue` expectation, the `100` response indicates that the server wishes to receive the request payload body. The client ought to continue sending the request and discard the `100` response.
1. If the request did not contain an `Expect` header field containing the `100-continue` expectation, the client can simply discard this interim response.
