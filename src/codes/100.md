body: |
  The HTTP 100 Continue informational status response code indicates that everything so far is OK and that the client should continue with the request or ignore it if it is already finished.

  To have a server check the request's headers, a client **must** send `Expect: 100-continue` as a header in its initial request and receive a 100 Continue status code in response before sending the body.

<!-- HTTP statuses -->
1. The initial part of a request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The server intends to send a final response after the request has been fully received and acted upon.
1. When the request contains an `Expect` header field that includes a `100-continue` expectation, the `100` response indicates that the server wishes to receive the request payload body. The client ought to continue sending the request and discard the `100` response.
1. If the request did not contain an `Expect` header field containing the `100-continue` expectation, the client can simply discard this interim response.
