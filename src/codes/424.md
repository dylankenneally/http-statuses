## Takeaways

The method could not be performed on the resource because the requested action depended on another action, and that action failed.

## Information

Regular web servers will normally not return this status code. But some other protocols, like WebDAV, can return it. For example, in WebDAV, if a `PROPPATCH` request was issued, and one command fails then automatically every other command will also fail with `424 Failed Dependency`.
