body: |
  The HTTP `201 Created` success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded and has led to the creation of a resource. The new resource, or a description and link to the new resource, is effectively created before the response is sent back and the newly created items are returned in the body of the message, located at either the URL of the request, or at the URL in the value of the `Location` header.

  The common use case of this status code is as the result of a `POST` request.
---

1. The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.
1. The primary resource created by the request is identified by either a `Location` header field in the response or, if no `Location` field is received, by the effective request URI.
1. The `201 Created` response payload typically describes and links to the resource(s) created. Refer to the Validator Header Fields link below for a discussion of the meaning and purpose of validator header fields, such as `ETag` and `Last-Modified`, in a 201 Created response.
