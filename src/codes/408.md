## Takeaways

1. The server did not receive a complete request message within the time that it was prepared to wait.
1. A server _should_ send the "close" connection option in the response, since `408` implies that the server has decided to close the connection rather than continue waiting.
1. If the client has an outstanding request in transit, the client _may_ repeat that request on a new connection.

## Information

{% admonition "Some servers merely shut down the connection without sending this message." | markdown %}

The `408 Request Timeout` response status code means that the server would like to shut down this unused connection. It is sent on an idle connection by some servers, even without any previous request by the client.

A server should send the "close" `Connection` header field in the response, since `408` implies that the server has decided to close the connection rather than continue waiting.

This response is used much more since some browsers, like Chrome, Firefox 27+, and IE9, use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms to speed up surfing.
