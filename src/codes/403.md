## Takeaways

1. The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
1. A server that wishes to make public why the request has been forbidden can describe that reason in the response payload (if any).
1. If authentication credentials were provided in the request, the server considers them insufficient to grant access.
1. The client _should not_ automatically repeat the request with the same credentials.
1. The client _may_ repeat the request with new or different credentials. However, a request might be forbidden for reasons unrelated to the credentials.
1. An origin server that wishes to "hide" the current existence of a forbidden target resource _may_ instead respond with a status code of `404 Not Found`.

## Information

The `403 Forbidden` response status code indicates that the server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.

This status is similar to `401`, but for the `403 Forbidden` status code, re-authenticating makes no difference. The access is tied to the application logic, such as insufficient rights to a resource.
