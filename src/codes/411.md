## Takeaways

1. The server refuses to accept the request without a defined `Content-Length`.
1. The client _may_ repeat the request if it adds a valid `Content-Length` header field containing the length of the message body in the request message.

## Information

{% admonition "When sending data in a series of chunks, the Content-Length header is omitted and at the beginning of each chunk you need to add the length of the current chunk in hexadecimal format. Refer to the `Transfer-Encoding` header." | markdown %}
