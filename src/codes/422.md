## Takeaways

{% admonition "The client should not repeat this request without modification."  | markdown %}

1. The server understands the content type of the request entity (hence a `415 Unsupported Media Type` status code is inappropriate).
1. The syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a `400 Bad Request` status code is inappropriate).
1. But the server was unable to process the contained instructions.

For example, this error condition may occur if an XML request body contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but semantically erroneous, XML instructions.
