  The HTTP `101 Switching Protocols` response code indicates a protocol to which the server switches. The protocol is specified in the `Upgrade` request header received from a client.

  The server includes in this response an `Upgrade` response header to indicate the protocol it switched to. The process is described in the Protocol upgrade mechanism article referenced below.
---

1. The server understands and is willing to comply with the client's request, via the `Upgrade` header field, for a change in the application protocol being used on this connection.
1. The server **must** generate an `Upgrade` header field in the response that indicates which protocol(s) will be switched to immediately after the empty line that terminates the `101` response.
1. It is assumed that the server will only agree to switch protocols when it is advantageous to do so. For example, switching to a newer version of HTTP might be advantageous over older versions, and switching to a real-time, synchronous protocol might be advantageous when delivering resources that use such features.
