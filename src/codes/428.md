## Takeaways

1. The origin server requires the request to be conditional.
1. Its typical use is to avoid the "lost update" problem, where a client `GET`s a resource's state, modifies it, and `PUT`s it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict.
1. By requiring requests to be conditional, the server can assure that clients are working with the correct copies.

Responses using this status code _should_ explain how to resubmit the request successfully.

## Example

<span class="multipart-codeblock">

```http
HTTP/1.1 428 Precondition Required
Content-Type: text/html
```

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Precondition Required</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Precondition Required</h1>
    <p>This request is required to be conditional; try using "If-Match".</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

</span>

## Information

Responses with the `428` status code **must not** be stored by a cache.

When a precondition header is not matching the server side state, the response should be `412 Precondition Failed`.
