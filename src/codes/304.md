{% admonition "Many developer tools' network panels of browsers create extraneous requests leading to `304` responses, so that access to the local cache is visible to developers." | markdown %}

## Takeaways

1. A conditional `GET` or `HEAD` request has been received and would have resulted in a `200 OK` response if it were not for the fact that the condition evaluated to false.
1. There is no need for the server to transfer a representation of the target resource because the request indicates that the client, which made the request conditional, already has a valid representation.
1. The server is therefore redirecting the client to make use of that stored representation as if it were the payload of a `200 OK`.
1. The server generating a `304` response **must** generate any of the following header fields that would have been sent in a `200 OK` response to the same request: `Cache-Control`, `Content-Location`, `Date`, `ETag`, `Expires`, and `Vary`.

Since the goal of a `304` response is to minimize information transfer when the recipient already has one or more cached representations, a sender _should not_ generate representation metadata other than the above listed fields unless said metadata exists for the purpose of guiding cache updates (e.g., `Last-Modified` might be useful if the response does not have an `ETag` field).

If the conditional request originated with an outbound client, such as a user agent with its own cache sending a conditional `GET` to a shared proxy, then the proxy _should_ forward the `304` response to that client.

A `304` response cannot contain a message-body; it is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.

## Information

The `304 Not Modified` client redirection response code indicates that there is no need to retransmit the requested resources. It is an implicit redirection to a cached resource. This happens when the request method is a safe method, such as `GET` or `HEAD`, or when the request is conditional and uses an `If-None-Match` or an `If-Modified-Since `header.

The equivalent `200 OK` response would have included the headers `Cache-Control`, `Content-Location`, `Date`, `ETag`, `Expires`, and `Vary`.
