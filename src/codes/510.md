## Takeaways

1. The policy for accessing the resource has not been met in the request.
1. The server should send back all the information necessary for the client to issue an extended request.

## Information

If the `510` response contains information about extensions that were not present in the initial request then the client _may_ repeat the request if it has reason to believe it can fulfil the extension policy by modifying the request according to the information provided in the `510` response. Otherwise the client _may_ present any entity included in the `510` response to the user, since that entity may include relevant diagnostic information.
