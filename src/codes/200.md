## Takeaways

1. Aside from responses to `CONNECT`, a `200 OK` response always has a payload, though an origin server _may_ generate a payload body of zero length.
1. If no payload is desired, an origin server ought to send `204 No Content` instead.
1. For `CONNECT`, no payload is allowed because the successful result is a tunnel, which begins immediately after the `200 OK` response header section.

A 200 response is cacheable by default; unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls.

## Information

The HTTP `200 OK` success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded. A `200` response is cacheable by default.

The meaning of a success depends on the HTTP request method:

- `GET`: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.
- `HEAD`: The representation headers are included in the response without any message body
- `POST`: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body
- `TRACE`: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.

The successful result of a `PUT` or a `DELETE` is often not a `200 OK` but a `204 No Content` (or a `201 Created` when the resource is uploaded for the first time).
