## Takeaways

1. The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response.
1. This can be sent by a server that is not configured to produce responses for the combination of scheme and authority that are included in the request URI.
1. Clients receiving a `421 Misdirected Request` response from a server _may_ retry the request, whether the request method is idempotent or not, over a different connection.
1. This is possible if a connection is reused or if an alternative service is selected.

## Information

This status code **must not** be generated by proxies.

A `421` response is cacheable by default, i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls.
