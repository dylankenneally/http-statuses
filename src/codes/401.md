## Takeaways

1. The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
1. The server generating a `401` response **must** send a `WWW-Authenticate` header field containing at least one challenge applicable to the target resource.
1. If the request included authentication credentials, then the `401` response indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials.
1. The user agent _may_ repeat the request with a new or replaced `Authorization` header field.
1. If the `401` response contains the same challenge as the prior response, and the user agent has already attempted authentication at least once, then the user agent _should_ present the enclosed representation to the user, since it usually contains relevant diagnostic information.

## Information

This status code is similar to the `403 Forbidden` status code, except that in situations resulting in this status code, user authentication can allow access to the resource.

## Example

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT
