## Takeaways

1. The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.
1. Clients with link-editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link references to the effective request URI to one or more of the new references sent by the server, where possible.
1. The server _should_ generate a `Location` header field in the response containing a preferred URI reference for the new permanent URI.
1. The user agent _may_ use the `Location` field value for automatic redirection.
1. The server's response payload usually contains a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).

A 301 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls.

{% admonition "Although the specification requires the method and the body to remain unchanged when the redirection is performed, not all user-agents meet this requirement.

Use the `301` code only as a response for `GET` or `HEAD` methods and use the `308 Permanent Redirect` for `POST` methods instead, as the method change is explicitly prohibited with this status." | markdown %}
