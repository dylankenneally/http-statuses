## Takeaways

1. The server is refusing to process a request because the request payload is larger than the server is willing or able to process.
1. The server _may_ close the connection to prevent the client from continuing the request.
1. If the condition is temporary, the server _should_ generate a `Retry-After` header field to indicate that it is temporary and after what time the client _may_ try again.

## Information

This status code used to be named `Payload Too Large`. That name is still widely used.
