1. An interim response used to inform the client that the server has accepted the complete request, but has not yet completed it.
1. This status code _should_ only be sent when the server has a reasonable expectation that the request will take significant time to complete. As guidance, if a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to process the server _should_ return a `102 Processing` response. The server **must** send a final response after the request has been completed.
1. Methods can potentially take a long period of time to process, especially methods that support the `Depth` header. In such cases the client may time-out the connection while waiting for a response. To prevent this the server may return a `102 Processing` status code to indicate to the client that the server is still processing the method.
