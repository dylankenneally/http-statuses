## Takeaways

1. Similar to `401 Unauthorized`, but it indicates that the client needs to authenticate itself in order to use a proxy.
1. The proxy **must** send a Proxy-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to that proxy for the target resource.
1. The client _may_ repeat the request with a new or replaced `Proxy-Authorization` header field.

## Example

```http
HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Authentication Required
Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT
Proxy-Authenticate: Basic realm="Access to internal site"
```
