## Takeaways

1. The server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol.
1. The server **must** send an `Upgrade` header field in a `426` response to indicate the required protocol(s).

## Example

```http
HTTP/1.1 426 Upgrade Required
Upgrade: HTTP/3.0
Connection: Upgrade
Content-Length: 53
Content-Type: text/plain

This service requires use of the HTTP/3.0 protocol.
```
