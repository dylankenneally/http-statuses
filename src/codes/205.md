  The `205 Reset Content` response status tells the client to reset the document view, so for example to clear the content of a form, reset a canvas state, or to refresh the UI.

1. The server has fulfilled the request and desires that the user agent reset the "document view", which caused the request to be sent, to its original state as received from the origin server.
1. This response is intended to support a common data entry use case where the user receives content that supports data entry (a form, notepad, canvas, etc.), enters or manipulates data in that space, causes the entered data to be submitted in a request, and then the data entry mechanism is reset for the next entry so that the user can easily initiate another input action.
1. Since the `205` status code implies that no additional content will be provided, a server **must not** generate a payload in a `205` response.

A server **must** do one of the following for a `205` response:

- indicate a zero-length body for the response by including a `Content-Length` header field with a value of `0`.
- indicate a zero-length payload for the response by including a `Transfer-Encoding` header field with a value of `chunked` and a message body consisting of a single chunk of zero-length.
- close the connection immediately after sending the blank line terminating the header section.
