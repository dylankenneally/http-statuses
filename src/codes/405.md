## Takeaways

1. The method received in the request-line is known by the origin server but not supported by the target resource.
1. The origin server **must** generate an `Allow` header field in a `405` response containing a list of the target resource's currently supported methods.

## Information

A `405` response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls.
