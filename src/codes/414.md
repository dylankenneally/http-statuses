## Takeaways

1. The server is refusing to service the request because the request-target is longer than the server is willing to interpret.
1. This rare condition is only likely to occur when a client has improperly converted a `POST` request to a `GET` request with long query information.
1. I.e. when the client has descended into a "black hole" of redirection (e.g., a redirected URI prefix that points to a suffix of itself) or when the server is under attack by a client attempting to exploit potential security holes.

## Information

The HTTP `414 URI Too Long` response status code indicates that the URI requested by the client is longer than the server is willing to interpret.

There are a few rare conditions when this might occur:

- when a client has improperly converted a `POST` request to a `GET` request with long query information,
- when the client has descended into a loop of redirection (for example, a redirected URI prefix that points to a suffix of itself),
- or when the server is under attack by a client attempting to exploit potential security holes.

A `414` response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls.
