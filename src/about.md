## What is HTTP Statuses?

HTTP Statuses is an easy-to-use reference guide for HTTP response status codes. Whether you're a seasoned developer debugging an API response or just starting to learn about web development, this site provides clear, concise explanations for every HTTP status code.

## Why This Site?

HTTP status codes are fundamental to web communication, yet many developers find themselves repeatedly searching for what each code means. This reference was created to provide:

- **Quick access** to status code information.
- **Clear explanations** in plain language.
- **Official specifications** linked directly to the HTTP Working Group.
- **Related codes** to help understand the context.
- **Further reading** for those who want to dive deeper.

## Status Code Categories

HTTP status codes are grouped into five categories:

- **1xx Informational** - The request was received and is being processed.
- **2xx Successful** - The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
- **3xx Redirection** - Further action needs to be taken to complete the request.
- **4xx Client Error** - The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
- **5xx Server Error** - The server failed to fulfill a valid request.
